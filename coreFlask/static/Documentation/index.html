    <h1>Welcome to StackEdit!</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm your first Markdown file in <strong>StackEdit</strong>. If you want to learn about StackEdit, you can
        read me. If you want to play with Markdown, you can edit me. If you have finished with me, you can just create
        new files by opening the <strong>file explorer</strong> on the left corner of the navigation bar.</p>
    <h1>Files</h1>
    <p>StackEdit stores your files in your browser, which means all your files are automatically saved locally and are
        accessible <strong>offline!</strong></p>
    <h2>Create files and folders</h2>
    <p>The file explorer is accessible using the button in left corner of the navigation bar. You can create a new file
        by clicking the <strong>New file</strong> button in the file explorer. You can also create folders by clicking
        the <strong>New folder</strong> button.</p>
    <h2>Switch to another file</h2>
    <p>All your files are listed in the file explorer. You can switch from one to another by clicking a file in the
        list.</p>
    <h2>Rename a file</h2>
    <p>You can rename the current file by clicking the file name in the navigation bar or by clicking the
        <strong>Rename</strong> button in the file explorer.</p>
    <h2>Delete a file</h2>
    <p>You can delete the current file by clicking the <strong>Remove</strong> button in the file explorer. The file
        will be moved into the <strong>Trash</strong> folder and automatically deleted after 7 days of inactivity.</p>
    <h2>Export a file</h2>
    <p>You can export the current file by clicking <strong>Export to disk</strong> in the menu. You can choose to export
        the file as plain Markdown, as HTML using a Handlebars template or as a PDF.</p>
    <h1>Synchronization</h1>
    <p>Synchronization is one of the biggest features of StackEdit. It enables you to synchronize any file in your
        workspace with other files stored in your <strong>Google Drive</strong>, your <strong>Dropbox</strong> and your
        <strong>GitHub</strong> accounts. This allows you to keep writing on other devices, collaborate with people you
        share the file with, integrate easily into your workflow... The synchronization mechanism takes place every
        minute in the background, downloading, merging, and uploading file modifications.</p>
    <p>There are two types of synchronization and they can complement each other:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>The workspace synchronization will sync all your files, folders and settings automatically. This will
                allow you to fetch your workspace on any other device.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>To start syncing your workspace, just sign in with Google in the menu.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The file synchronization will keep one file of the workspace synced with one or multiple files in
                <strong>Google Drive</strong>, <strong>Dropbox</strong> or <strong>GitHub</strong>.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Before starting to sync files, you must link an account in the <strong>Synchronize</strong> sub-menu.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Open a file</h2>
    <p>You can open a file from <strong>Google Drive</strong>, <strong>Dropbox</strong> or <strong>GitHub</strong> by
        opening the <strong>Synchronize</strong> sub-menu and clicking <strong>Open from</strong>. Once opened in the
        workspace, any modification in the file will be automatically synced.</p>
    <h2>Save a file</h2>
    <p>You can save any file of the workspace to <strong>Google Drive</strong>, <strong>Dropbox</strong> or <strong>GitHub</strong>
        by opening the <strong>Synchronize</strong> sub-menu and clicking <strong>Save on</strong>. Even if a file in
        the workspace is already synced, you can save it to another location. StackEdit can sync one file with multiple
        locations and accounts.</p>
    <h2>Synchronize a file</h2>
    <p>Once your file is linked to a synchronized location, StackEdit will periodically synchronize it by
        downloading/uploading any modification. A merge will be performed if necessary and conflicts will be
        resolved.</p>
    <p>If you just have modified your file and you want to force syncing, click the <strong>Synchronize now</strong>
        button in the navigation bar.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>Synchronize now</strong> button is disabled if you have no file to
            synchronize.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Manage file synchronization</h2>
    <p>Since one file can be synced with multiple locations, you can list and manage synchronized locations by clicking
        <strong>File synchronization</strong> in the <strong>Synchronize</strong> sub-menu. This allows you to list and
        remove synchronized locations that are linked to your file.</p>
    <h1>Publication</h1>
    <p>Publishing in StackEdit makes it simple for you to publish online your files. Once you're happy with a file, you
        can publish it to different hosting platforms like <strong>Blogger</strong>, <strong>Dropbox</strong>, <strong>Gist</strong>,
        <strong>GitHub</strong>, <strong>Google Drive</strong>, <strong>WordPress</strong> and <strong>Zendesk</strong>.
        With <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/" rel="nofollow">Handlebars templates</a>, you have full control over what
        you export.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Before starting to publish, you must link an account in the <strong>Publish</strong> sub-menu.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Publish a File</h2>
    <p>You can publish your file by opening the <strong>Publish</strong> sub-menu and by clicking <strong>Publish
        to</strong>. For some locations, you can choose between the following formats:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Markdown: publish the Markdown text on a website that can interpret it (<strong>GitHub</strong> for
            instance),
        </li>
        <li>HTML: publish the file converted to HTML via a Handlebars template (on a blog for example).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Update a publication</h2>
    <p>After publishing, StackEdit keeps your file linked to that publication which makes it easy for you to re-publish
        it. Once you have modified your file and you want to update your publication, click on the <strong>Publish
            now</strong> button in the navigation bar.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>Publish now</strong> button is disabled if your file has not been
            published yet.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Manage file publication</h2>
    <p>Since one file can be published to multiple locations, you can list and manage publish locations by clicking
        <strong>File publication</strong> in the <strong>Publish</strong> sub-menu. This allows you to list and remove
        publication locations that are linked to your file.</p>
    <h1>Markdown extensions</h1>
    <p>StackEdit extends the standard Markdown syntax by adding extra <strong>Markdown extensions</strong>, providing
        you with some nice features.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>ProTip:</strong> You can disable any <strong>Markdown extension</strong> in the <strong>File
            properties</strong> dialog.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>SmartyPants</h2>
    <p>SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For
        example:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>ASCII</th>
            <th>HTML</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Single backticks</td>
            <td><code>'Isn't this fun?'</code></td>
            <td>'Isn't this fun?'</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Quotes</td>
            <td><code>"Isn't this fun?"</code></td>
            <td>"Isn't this fun?"</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Dashes</td>
            <td><code>-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash</code></td>
            <td>-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <h2>KaTeX</h2>
    <p>You can render LaTeX mathematical expressions using <a href="https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/"
                                                              rel="nofollow">KaTeX</a>:</p>

    <h2>UML diagrams</h2>
    <p>You can render UML diagrams using <a href="https://mermaidjs.github.io/" rel="nofollow">Mermaid</a>. For example,
        this will produce a sequence diagram:</p>
    <pre lang="mermaid"><code>sequenceDiagram
Alice -&gt;&gt; Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob--&gt;&gt;John: How about you John?
Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
Note right of John: Bob thinks a long&lt;br/&gt;long time, so long&lt;br/&gt;that the text does&lt;br/&gt;not fit on a row.

Bob--&gt;Alice: Checking with John...
Alice-&gt;John: Yes... John, how are you?
</code></pre>
    <p>And this will produce a flow chart:</p>
    <pre lang="mermaid"><code>graph LR
A[Square Rect] -- Link text --&gt; B((Circle))
A --&gt; C(Round Rect)
B --&gt; D{Rhombus}
C --&gt; D

    <h1>Catan</h1>

        <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="game_die"

        A map generator for Catan, both classic game and extended.
    </p>
    <p>For now, no seafarers supported, but maybe in the future, it will, who knows.<br>
        This was developed with <code>numpy</code>, so if you don't have it already, please install it. Amazing
        tool
        for
        probabilities and statistics and all sorts of stuff.</p>
    <h2>How to use</h2>
    <h4>Download</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>First, clone/download the repository:<br>
                <code>git clone https://github.com/Japjappedulap/Catan.git</code></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Install <code>numpy</code> (if you don't already have it):<br>
                <code>pip3 install numpy</code></p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Use</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>For generating a classic map, just run <code>python3 classic.py</code>. The result should be
                something
                like
                this:</p>
            <pre><code>             DESE 0      OREE 6      LUMB 2
       GRAI 8      WOOL 3      CLAY10      WOOL 9
 WOOL12      OREE10      LUMB 6      GRAI11      CLAY 5
       CLAY 8      GRAI 3      WOOL 4      LUMB 9
             LUMB11      OREE 5      GRAI 4
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>For generating an extended map, run <code>python3 extended.py</code>. Careful at this one, the
                map
                isn't
                symmetric</p>
            <pre><code>                   DESE 0      OREE 8      WOOL12      GRAI 8
             LUMB 9      WOOL11      GRAI 4      OREE 5      LUMB12
       OREE 3      CLAY10      LUMB 6      CLAY 3      GRAI 9      CLAY 6
 CLAY 6      GRAI 4      WOOL 3      OREE10      WOOL 9      LUMB 2
       LUMB11      CLAY 5      LUMB10      GRAI11      OREE 5
             WOOL 4      GRAI 2      WOOL 8      DESE 0
</code></pre>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: generations will take time, maybe a lot of time, do not be surprised if you
            wait
            3-4
            minutes for an extended map. A classic map should be rendered in no more than one minute.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h5>Reading this mess</h5>
    <p>Each 'entry' consists of a resource tile and a dice number <code>GRAI 9</code> means a grain resource
        tile
        with a
        dice of 9 on it.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>DESE</code> = Desert, always with 0, no dice on it (duh...)</li>
        <li><code>LUMB</code> = Lumber</li>
        <li><code>WOOL</code> = Wool</li>
        <li><code>GRAI</code> = Grain</li>
        <li><code>OREE</code> = Ore</li>
        <li><code>CLAY</code> = Clay</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why this?</h2>
    <p>The maps generated aren't always perfect, but they're getting as close as ever to perfection. The
        distribution of
        dice numbers across the resources is extremely balanced. The positioning of all tiles is done such that
        no
        place
        is
        favored over the other, there is no <em>really good</em> spot, most of them are equally good and equally
        balanced.
        Of course, it's still the rolled dice which dictates the game, but at least, the map is balanced.</p>
    <h4>Still missing</h4>
    <p>Even if the tiles placement is great, there is a single lacking feature. The harbor
        <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="anchor"
                 fallback-src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2693.png">⚓️
        </g-emoji>
        configurations. You can still place the tiles rotated as you want, to make the entire map more
        enjoyable,
        just
        don't
        overdo it.
