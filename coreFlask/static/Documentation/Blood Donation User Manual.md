#### **1. Application description**
The blood donation application **"FLOW."** is a solution designed for a better management of the blood donation process, designed to make the work of the donation center personnel easier, as well as encourage the donors to donate more often. To make it accessible for any user, regardless of their experience in using it, **FLOW** comes in the form of a site, that is both modern and intuitive at the same time, thanks to the state of the art technologies used in the development process.

Using this solution, the doctors can make blood request in a matter of seconds and see at any time how their request is managed by the donation center employees, who can notify the donors about a need of blood, as well as manage the existing blood bags.

Donors will be rapidly notified about a request, the application telling them if they are eligible to donate, as well as providing them a medical background based on data collected the last time they donated blood.
#### **2. User Types**
As it was designed to be used at the same time by both donors and medical personnel by sharing the same user-friendly interface, the application will make a distinction between these user types:
* The unregistered user (not logged in) does not have access to anything, having to log in first.  They can recover a lost passoword or they can register as a new donor.
* There are 3 types of registered users:
	*  Donors can register on the platform, donate and check their blood donation history.
	*  Doctors can request blood bags for their patients and see the state of their request, they can update a request's priority status and also to see a list of all of their requests; 
	*  Nurses are the donation center personnel, being able to manage donors and blood bags;
